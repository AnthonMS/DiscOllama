# DiscOllama - Your Personal Discord AI Chatbot

DiscOllama is a Discord bot that uses Ollama as the backend LLM provider. It's designed to provide an interactive and engaging experience for Discord users.

## Features

- Ollama LLM server integration: The bot uses Ollama to process and generate responses based on user input and past interactions.

## Developer's Notes

This is just a stupid idea that I had to try after playing around with Ollama and different LLMs for a day or two. I quickly googled if it had an API to interact with Ollama and so many ideas started running through my mind. I can now host a local AI for my smart home as well. Hmmm... My mind is racing with ideas.

So to learn the API and start some kind of project, learning to create a discord bot was something that was on the TODO list as well anyway, I decided this was probably a fun little project. So lets see where this takes me.

## Getting Started (For future. No requirements.txt yet. This is going to change a lot in the next couple of days.)

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and fill it with your configuration values. Use the `example.env` file as a template.
4. Run the bot by executing `python main.py`.
